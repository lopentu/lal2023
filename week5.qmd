# 本週主題
- Morphology



## 語言結構

- 構詞學 (*Morphology*) the analysis of internal structure of words

- 句法 (*Syntax*) the analysis of the internal structure of sentences/utterances

## 注意【界面】問題
題型設計上（語言使用上也是），常常放在一起討論。

- 構詞句法 (*Morphosyntax*) the analysis of the internal structure of utterances, both above the word level and below it.

## 例子：[English Numeral Modification]{.blue-text}

`one tree, two trees, three trees`, etc. 

同時涉及句法 (名詞於數量詞的次序) 和 構詞 (名詞的單複數變化)。

# 構詞學
**Morphology**

- The study of word-making, morphological process and morphological types of world Languages.
- Rules underlying our knowledge of structured of words.



## Word

## 岔開做一個實驗

- Content words (open class) vs function words (closed class).
    - Any psychological or neurological evidence? (count the number of F’s in the following text)

## Morpheme


- The minimal units of Meaning (a linguistic hypothesis)
    - one morpheme: boy
    - two morphemes: boy-ish
    - three morphemes: boy-ish-ness
    - four morphemes: gentle-man-li-ness
    - five morphemes: un-gentle-man-li-ness		

- not to confuse morphemes with syllables
    - *Mississippi* has more than one syllable but is only a single morpheme
    <!-- - 鄒語的 amo「爸爸」 -->

- Every word in every language is composed of one or more morphemes (bold hypothesis of discreteness!)



## Morphemes: Bound and Free

- can be used alone (i.e., as a word) or not.
- Affix (prefix, suffix, infix, circumfix,...)
- Morphologically complex words consist of a root and one or more affixes.
    - A root is a lexical content morphemes that cannot be analyzed into small parts.
    - When a root morpheme is combined with an affix, it forms a stem, which may or may not be a word.

## English morpheme

## Infix
- The Inuktitut language of Western Canada, a member of the Eskimo-Aleut language family, has an infix, [-pallia-]{.red}, which must be inserted into a verb root, resulting in a distinct form of the verb.

    
    - `nungup + pallia + jut  = nungupalliajut` ("They are gradually disappearing")
    - `ilinniaq + pallia + jugut = ilinniapalliajugut` ("We are gradually learning")



## Exercise: Expletive Infixation

- The most common infix in America is the word fuckin’ and all the euphemisms for it, such as friggin, freakin, flippin, and fuggin, as in in-fuggin-credible, un-fuckin-believable. In Britain, a common infix is bloody, an obscene term in British English, and its euphemisms, such as bloomin’. (as in the movie and stage musical My Fair Lady, the word abso + bloomin + lutely) 	

- Native speakers (with some dialectal variations) have intuitions about where to insert the (expletive) infix.

## 歧義練習

- 歧義 (ambiguity) is a property of language that arises when a word or phrase can be interpreted in more than one way.
- types of ambiguity:
    - lexical ambiguity
    - syntactic ambiguity

## Morphological Processes

- The (main) process of forming words
    - Affixation
    - Compounding
    - Reduplication
    - Alternation
    - Suppletion
    - ....

:::{.callout-note}
Sign languages make use of affixation as well.

## Morphological Typology 
用構詞特徵來把人類語言分成兩大類


- **Analytic language**: made up of sequences of free morphemes. Each word consists of a single morpheme, used by itself with meaning and function intact. 
    - Purely analytic languages, also called isolating languages, do not use affixes to compose words.
    - E.g., Chinese has a highly analytic structure.


<!-- language in which syntactic relations are expressed primarily by word order rather than by in ectional morphemes attached to words. (e.g, ?) -->

- **Synthetic language**: made up of sequences of bound morphemes.

    ![Hungarian](pics/synthetic.png){width=80%}


## Synthetic language 再分三類 

- **Agglutinative language**: have several morphemes that attach to a root morpheme, and each morpheme has only one meaning that is clearly distinct. (e.g., Turkish, Swahili, Japanese).

![swahili](pics/swahili.png){width=80%}


    


## 
- **Fusional language**
    - words are formed by adding bound morphemes to stems, just as in agglutinating languages, but in fusional languages the affixes may not be easy to separate from the stem. 
    - in fusional languages a single affix more frequently conveys several meanings simultaneously. (e.g., the following sentence in Russian, the suffix [-l] means singular, masculine, and past tense, simultaneously.)

    `[[ʧital]`  `he was reading' 


##
- **Polysynthetic language**
    
    - highly complex words may be formed by combining several stems and affixes; this is usually a matter of making nouns (subjects, objects, etc.) into parts of the verb forms.

    - e.g., Sora, a language spoken in India, allows such incorporation of objects (subjects, instruments, etc.) into verbs

## Challenging yet unresolved morphological issue: Word/Wordhood

- What are words / lexicon (a mental dictionary you store your ‘words’) like?
    - the lack of pauses between ‘words’ in speech 
    - the lack of boundary between ‘words’ in (some) writing systems
    - note that no spaces when we speak

`Iwonderifyoucanreadthiswithoutspacesaseasilyasyoucanwhentherearespacesbetweenthewords.
`

## What about Chinese?
- less than 80% agreement in word counts experiment
- Character = morpheme = syllable ???


:::{.callout-warning}

The indeterminacy of word boundaries shows that "word" is far from a simple concept, and possibly not possible to define in a consistent way cross-linguistically. (Haspelmath, 2011)
